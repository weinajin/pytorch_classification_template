This pipeline requires some input files pertaining to the validation and query image data. These files can be found in /local-scratch/culprit_neuron/skindata on ts09. So if you want to run this pipeline on your fav server in the lab you'll have to move some files around after you pull this repo. I did not push these files to the github because the images needs to generate the activation maps take up a lot of space. DS March 22 2019.
